# mj-gent/lab - README

Personal scripts for fun and study. 

Scripts here are intended for neither large-scale nor monetized projects; for example,
my first two contributions are: a Powershell script that randomizes the custom string 
of the default "3D Text" screensaver based on a text file, and a Python script that 
can encrypt/decrypt a silly cipher I designed. 

I share these scripts for the curious to poke at, so do suggest a license if you feel 
that the MIT License attribution is inappropriate.
